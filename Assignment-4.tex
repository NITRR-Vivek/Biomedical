\section{Introduction}
The Term ''Distruptive Innovations'' First Coined by \href{https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation}{Professor Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School} and It Means a change that transforms an existing product, service or process. It helps create a new market, eventually disrupting existing markets and displacing previous technologies.

\subparagraph W \hspace{-4mm}hen it comes to healthcare, we see disruption can be a fundamental mechanism through which we can build a higher quality, more convenient, and lower cost healthcare system. Without disruption, healthcare systems and organisations not only get left behind, but community health and wellbeing also potentially suffers.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Importance of Disruptive technology in healthcare}
The greatest opportunities for disruptive innovation are in low profit-margin services, such as primary care, mental health, and home care.  Innovators can help consumers to become and remain healthy and to achieve financial independence.They can also make employees as productive as possible.  Disruptive innovators will be paid to keep people healthy, with fewer trips to the hospital or emergency room.  By improving population health and patient engagement, they will reduce the hospital admissions by Large Amount.


\subsection{Disruptive Inovation Examples}
People Have Come With Various Disruptive Innovations in Healthcare, Some of The Examples are Stated Below.\\

\ding{112}\textbf{ Home monitoring applications }: Patient self-assessment and self-care have become a key part of healthcare innovation since widespread smartphone adoption created easy internet access. In France, The App \href{https://www.npr.org/2020/04/29/847171229/in-paris-a-new-app-is-helping-doctors-monitor-covid-19-patients-remotely}{'Covidom'} helps patients to manage their mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms at home. The app allows a regional control centre to monitor and analyse all results, ensuring patients at home can be hospitalised or have an ambulance called if necessary. 

\ding{112}\textbf{ 3-D Printing in Healthcare }: 3-D is One of the famous disruptive innovations in Healthcare. From Helping in Making Medical Tools From Various Constructive Tools that range From Plastic to Stem Cells. This BioPrinting is Used for the Regeneration of Medicine and Supports Tissue Engineering. Not Only This, But it Helps in Manufacturing and Tailoring Precision, and Even Personal Pharmaceuticals.

\ding{112}\textbf{ Wearables Technology }: Patients Can Now gather Health Data from Wearables, Bluetooth Devices and smart watches. Mobile Fitness trackers allow consumers to play a new role in their Health Journey.

\ding{112}\textbf{ Telemedicine }: It is One of the Most Disruptive Innovations in Healthcare since the recent pandemic times.
 It is the Process of Practicing Medicine but at a distance by Health Proffessionals to the Patients.

\ding{112}\textbf{ Virtual Reality in Healthcare} : It is Said That the Future of the Healthcare System is more Likely to be Virtual than Physical as We Speak.
VR (Virtual reality) is Being Used to manage the Stress and Anxiety Levels and helping Stablized State.

\ding{112}\textbf{ Presion Medicine }: When Medicines  are According to a Sole Person's Needs, They Autometically become Tailor-Made and Quickly Help Treat the Person and Cure them. Not Only This Will This Reduce Expenditure in General, but It Will Revolutionize Preventive Measures.Favourable For All !

\ding{112}\textbf{ Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)} : It is A New Concept in Healthcare, \href{https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-internet-of-medical-things-part-1-a-new-concept-in-healthcare-83654.html}{The IoMT System} caters to professionals who need to Manage all sorts of Data such as Records of Different Patients, Inventory Control, Monitoring and Various Preventive Measures to Patients.

\section{Conclusion}
Even Though We See a Noticable Change in Disruptive Innovation, One Must Understand That to Bring a Change Like This,
 The Administration Should be Train to Make The Workflow as Smooth and Efficient as the technology is Helping them do.
 As Catering to Patients Needs Moves and Relies More on the Automation and Visible incorporation Technology, We Must Understand that This is Essential.
 Healthcare Professionals Will be Leading This, and Hence the Technology and the Professionals Together will Make The World Better.
